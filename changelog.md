Ultimately `8/2               /2` will now return `2` (as it is running the equivalent of `(8/2)/2`) instead of `8` (as it used to run the equivalent of `8/(2/2)`). I.E. The change makes Math work as it does in VBA and most other programming languages.
- 2021-06-27 `stdArray` FIX - `stdArray#arr()` should use `CopyVariant` instead of `=`
- 2021-06-27 `stdEnumerator` FEATURE - `stdEnumerator::CreateEmpty()` added.

- 2021-07-07 `stdLambda` BREAKING - `#` is no longer valid inside `stdLambda` expression. Use `.` (for method OR property access), `.$` (for property specific access) or `.#` (for method specific access). I.E. If you have code like `obj#method` you should change this to `obj.method` as `.`. In some rare cases you may have to use `.#` instead.
- 2021-07-07 `stdLambda` FEATURE - Added `pEquation` property to `stdLambda` - useful while debugging.
- 2021-07-08 `stdEnumerator` FIX - Fixed an issue where `stdEnumerator#Sort()` through an error on empty arrays

- 2021-07-09 `stdWindow` FEATURE - Added optional Rect type parameter to x,y,width and height. Use `wnd.x(RectTypeClient) = ...` to modify with respect to the client rect.
- 2021-07-10 `stdLambda` FIX - Remove TODO statement from `stdLambda` evaluation loop.
- 2021-07-10 `stdLambda` FIX - Check for `Application` and `ThisWorkbook` existence in `stdLambda`. This brings `Word` and `VB6` compatibility.
- 2021-07-10 `stdProcess` BREAKING - All protected methods in `stdProcess` are now declared as `Friend` instead of `Public`.
- 2021-07-10 `stdProcess` FIX - Removed `stdProcess#moduleID` as it was always returning `0`. Need to look into how to get `moduleID`s in a class based setting.
- 2021-07-10 `stdProcess` NOTE - Added documentation note to all Time functions of stdProcess e.g. `stdProcess#TimeCreated()`, indicating that this function currently always returns time in UTC timezone.
- 2021-07-10 `stdProcess` BREAKING - `stdProcess::getProcessImageName` set to `Private`. This function should never have been public. Replace with `stdProcess.Create(...).path`
- 2021-07-10 `stdEnumerator` FIX - Fixed issue with `stdEnumerator::CreateFromListObject()` - compile error due to lack of test. Test added now and 100% working.

- 2021-08-05 `stdPerformance` FEATURE - Added optional parameter to stdPerformance which acts as a divisor for the final time. I.E. `totalTime/nCount`. Useful where you also loop internally over something to get a time per operation.
- 2021-08-05 `stdPerformance` FEATURE - Made sure per operation message is supplied as well as the absolute time it took to call.
- 2021-09-24 `stdProcess` FIX - Fixes massive slowdowns caused by legacy code.
- 2021-09-24 `stdWindow` FIX - Fix in Let method of RectByType property.
- 2021-09-24 `stdWindow` FEATURE - Added optional `iStaticDepthLimit` parameter to `FindFirst()` and `FindAll()`. Using this parameter you can quite easily limit your search to a certain depth. E.G. Search just the children with `iStaticDepthLimit:=1`.
- 2021-09-24 `stdWindow` FIX - Activate now works for windows outside of the Excel process too.
- 2021-09-24 `stdWindow` FEATURE - Added `SendKeysMessage()`, `SendKeysEvent()` and `SendKeysInput()` which can be used to send keys to a window. `SendKeysMessage` uses `PostMessageA`, `SendKeysEvent` uses `Keybd_event` and `SendKeysInput` uses `SendInput`.
